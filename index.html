<div class="blurb">

  <h1>The {{ site:simon_speck }} Families of Lightweight Block Ciphers</h1>

    <p>{{ site.simon_speck }} are families of lightweight block ciphers, each of which comes in a variety of widths and key sizes. The aim of {{ site.simon_speck }} is to fill the need for secure,
    flexible, and analyzable lightweight block ciphers that perform well on a wide range of current and future platforms.</p>

    <p>This site hosts general information about the algorithms with pointers to more detailed information available in other repositories or papers.</p>
