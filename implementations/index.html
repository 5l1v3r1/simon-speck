  <h2>{{ site.simon_speck }} Implementation Guide</h2>
  <p>The <a href="./ImplementationGuide.pdf">implementation guide</a> provides reference code for {{ site.simon_speck }} (64- and 128-bit block sized variants), including code for key scheduling, encryption, and decryption. It also describes the intended word ordering, and provides detailed test vectors and useful tips for improving performance on som ARM and x86 processors.</p>

  <h2>Higher-end Software</h2>

  <p>The <a href="https://github.com/nsacyber/simon-speck-supercop">simon-speck-supercop</a>
  repository includes X86 and ARM implementations using the SSE4.2, AVX2, and NEON instruction sets
  for high performance. While the implementations are structured for the <a
  href="https://bench.cr.yp.to/supercop.html">SUPERCOP benchmarking toolkit</a>, they should be
  adaptable to other systems.</p>

  <p>As an alternative to downloading the full SUPERCOP toolkit, just the
  {{ site.simon_speck }} code is available in
  <a href="./code/supercop/simon-speck.tar.xz">.tar.xz - 17 KB</a>,
  <a href="./code/supercop/simon-speck.tar.gz">.tar.gz - 50 KB</a>, and
  <a href="./code/supercop/simon-speck.zip">.zip - 167 KB</a> formats.</p>

  <h2>Microcontrollers</h2>

  <p>The University of Luxembourg <a href="https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/FELICS">Fair
  Evaluation of Lightweight Cryptographic Systems (FELICS) project</a> includes our
  contributions of a range of small and fast implementations of {{ site:simon_speck }} for the
  8-bit AVR, 16-bit MSP430, and 32-bit Cortex-M microcontrollers.</p>

  <h2>ASICs and FPGAs</h2>

  <p>We have unreleased implementations of {{ site.simon_speck }} for ASICs and FPGAs that have
  been documented in our papers. The team is glad to answer questions about ASIC and FPGA
  implementation of the algorithms.</p>
