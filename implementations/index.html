  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

  <p>The <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/404.pdf">original {{ site.simon_speck }}
  paper</a> is the best source for algorithm descriptions and test vectors.</p>

  <h2>Higher-end Software</h2>

  <p>The <a href="https://github.com/iadgov/simon-speck-supercop">simon-speck-supercop</a>
  repository includes X86 and ARM implementations using the SSE4.2, AVX2, and NEON instruction sets
  for high performance. While the implementations are structured for the <a
  href="https://bench.cr.yp.to/supercop.html">SUPERCOP benchmarking toolkit</a>, they should be
  adaptable to other systems.</p>

  <h2>Microcontrollers</h2>

  <p>The University of Luxembourg <a href="https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/FELICS">Fair
  Evaluation of Lightweight Cryptographic Systems (FELICS) project</a> includes our
  contributions of a range of small and fast implementations of {{ site:simon_speck }} for the
  8-bit AVR, 16-bit MSP430, and 32-bit Cortex-M microcontrollers.</p>

  <h2>ASICs and FPGAs</h2>

  <p>We have unreleased implementations of {{ site.simon_speck }} for ASICs and FPGAs that have
  been documented in our papers. The team is glad to answer questions about ASIC and FPGA
  implementation of the algorithms.</p>
